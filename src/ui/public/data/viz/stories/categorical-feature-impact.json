  "narrative": "This analysis examines how categorical features influence house sale prices.\n\nKey Categorical Features:\n- Overall Quality: Strongest predictor - quality ratings directly correlate with price\n- Overall Condition: Houses in better condition command higher prices\n- House Style: 2-story and newer styles tend to be more valuable\n- Building Type: Single-family detached homes are typically most valuable\n- Garage Type: Attached and built-in garages add more value\n- Foundation: Poured concrete foundations are associated with higher prices\n\nKey Insights:\n- Quality and condition ratings show clear step-wise price increases\n- Some categorical features may need encoding (one-hot, ordinal, or target encoding)\n- Feature interactions between categoricals can be important\n- Missing values in categoricals often represent \"None\" (e.g., no garage, no basement)\n\nUnderstanding these relationships helps in feature engineering and model selection for price prediction.",
