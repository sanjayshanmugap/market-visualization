  "narrative": "This analysis examines missing data patterns in the dataset.\n\nFeatures with Most Missing Data:\n- PoolQC: 99.5%\n- MiscFeature: 96.3%\n- Alley: 93.8%\n- Fence: 80.8%\n- MasVnrType: 59.7%\n\nKey Insights:\n- Many missing values represent \"None\" or \"Not Applicable\" (e.g., no pool, no garage, no basement)\n- Some features have systematic missingness that should be encoded as a separate category\n- Missing data patterns can reveal feature relationships (e.g., if no garage, GarageArea is missing)\n- Understanding missingness is crucial for proper imputation or encoding strategies\n\nHandling Missing Data:\n- Categorical: Encode \"NA\" as a category (e.g., \"No Garage\", \"No Pool\")\n- Numerical: May need imputation or indicator variables\n- Some missingness may be informative (e.g., missing basement = no basement)\n\nProper handling of missing data is essential for accurate price prediction.",
