  "narrative": "This analysis explores how time-related factors influence house sale prices.\n\nKey Findings:\n- Older houses (pre-1950) may have lower base prices but can be valuable if well-maintained\n- Newer construction (2000+) generally commands premium prices\n- Remodeled houses show significant price premiums over non-remodeled houses\n- Sale year trends may reflect market conditions during the sale period\n\nUnderstanding temporal patterns helps account for:\n- Age-related depreciation\n- Market timing effects\n- Value added through remodeling\n- Historical appreciation trends\n\nThese insights inform feature engineering for predictive models, such as creating age features and remodeling indicators.",
