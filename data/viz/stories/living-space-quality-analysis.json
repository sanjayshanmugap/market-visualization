  "narrative": "This analysis explores how living space and quality interact to determine house prices.\n\nKey Relationships:\n- Larger living areas generally command higher prices, but quality matters more\n- The relationship between size and price is non-linear - diminishing returns at larger sizes\n- Basement area adds value, especially when finished\n- Room count shows a positive relationship with price up to a point\n\nKey Insights:\n- Quality amplifies the value of living space - a small high-quality house can be worth more than a large low-quality one\n- There are optimal size ranges that maximize value per square foot\n- Outliers in living area may indicate data quality issues or special properties\n- Feature interactions between size and quality are important for prediction\n\nUnderstanding these relationships helps create better features for predictive modeling, such as:\n- Size per quality ratios\n- Optimal size indicators\n- Quality-adjusted size metrics",
